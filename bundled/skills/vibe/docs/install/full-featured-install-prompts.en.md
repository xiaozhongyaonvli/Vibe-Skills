# Full-Featured Install Prompts (Standard Recommended Install)

This document provides **copy-paste prompts for AI coding assistants / agents** so users can trigger the VibeSkills standard recommended install path more easily.

Boundary first:

- "full-featured" here means **repo-governed full closure**
- for most users, that is the same thing as the **standard recommended install**
- the current default lane should treat `scrapling` as a default local runtime surface
- the current default lane should treat `Cognee` as the governed long-term enhancement lane
- `Composio / Activepieces` should be described as prewired but setup-required external action surfaces
- Windows is the current strongest reference path
- Linux only reaches the current authoritative full-featured lane when `pwsh` is available
- Linux without `pwsh` can still install and run, but it is `degraded-but-supported`, not equivalent to the full Windows lane

## Universal Prompt

Use this when:

- the user does not want to choose platform-specific commands manually
- the agent should detect Windows vs Linux
- you want one-shot bootstrap + doctor + truthful boundary reporting

Copy:

```text
Please install the current repository using the VibeSkills recommended full-featured path, while staying strictly truth-first.

1. Detect whether the current system is Windows or Linux.
2. If it is Windows:
   - prefer `pwsh -File .\scripts\bootstrap\one-shot-setup.ps1`
   - then run `pwsh -File .\check.ps1 -Profile full -Deep`
   - if `pwsh` is unavailable, fall back to Windows PowerShell
3. If it is Linux:
   - first check whether `pwsh` is available
   - if `pwsh` is available, run `bash ./scripts/bootstrap/one-shot-setup.sh` and then `bash ./check.sh --profile full --deep`
   - and explicitly state that this is the Linux authoritative full-featured lane
   - if `pwsh` is not available, still run `bash ./scripts/bootstrap/one-shot-setup.sh` and `bash ./check.sh --profile full --deep`
   - but explicitly state that the result is only degraded-but-supported, and do not claim it is equivalent to full-featured Windows
4. After installation, give me a concise conclusion:
   - current platform
   - commands executed
   - final readiness_state
   - remaining host-managed surfaces
   - whether this platform has reached the strongest "recommended full-featured" state currently available
5. Do not pretend that host plugins, external MCP surfaces, or provider secrets were auto-installed.
6. Treat `scrapling` as part of the default full lane:
   - if Python packaging is available, allow the installer to attempt `scrapling[ai]`
   - report clearly whether the `scrapling` CLI ended up callable
7. Treat `Cognee` as the default long-term enhancement lane, not as a replacement for session truth.
8. Treat `Composio / Activepieces` as prewired external action integrations:
   - visible by default
   - still setup-required
   - not auto-enabled
   - still confirm-gated when enabled
9. If the result is `manual_actions_pending`, list the remaining manual actions instead of calling it a failure.
10. If host plugins still need to be provisioned, follow the current default policy:
   - recommend `superpowers` and `hookify` first
   - do not require `everything-claude-code`, `claude-code-settings`, and `ralph-loop` on first install by default
11. Do not modify runtime logic during this flow; only install, check, and summarize.
```

## Windows Prompt

Use this when:

- the user is clearly on Windows
- they want the strongest current reference path

Copy:

```text
Please install the current repository using the Windows recommended full-featured path.

Requirements:

1. Prefer `pwsh` and run:
   - `pwsh -File .\scripts\bootstrap\one-shot-setup.ps1`
   - `pwsh -File .\check.ps1 -Profile full -Deep`
2. If `pwsh` is unavailable, fall back to:
   - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\bootstrap\one-shot-setup.ps1`
   - `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\check.ps1 -Profile full -Deep`
3. After installation, tell me:
   - the readiness_state
   - whether this qualifies as the current Windows reference full-featured lane
   - which host-managed surfaces still need manual provisioning
4. Do not pretend host plugins, provider secrets, or plugin-backed MCP surfaces were completed automatically.
5. If the result is `manual_actions_pending`, list the remaining actions clearly.
6. Follow the current host-plugin default policy:
   - recommend `superpowers` and `hookify` first
   - do not require `everything-claude-code`, `claude-code-settings`, and `ralph-loop` on first install by default
```

## Linux Prompt

Use this when:

- the user is clearly on Linux
- they want the agent to handle the `pwsh` check

Copy:

```text
Please install the current repository using the Linux recommended full-featured path, and first determine whether this Linux environment has `pwsh`.

Requirements:

1. Check whether `pwsh` is available.
2. Run:
   - `bash ./scripts/bootstrap/one-shot-setup.sh`
   - `bash ./check.sh --profile full --deep`
3. If `pwsh` is available, explicitly tell me that the result is on the Linux authoritative full-featured lane.
4. If `pwsh` is not available, explicitly tell me:
   - the result is only degraded-but-supported
   - it must not be described as equivalent to the full Windows lane
5. After installation, summarize:
   - readiness_state
   - whether host-managed surfaces are still missing
   - whether I should add `pwsh`
   - whether I should provision host plugins next
6. Follow the current host-plugin default policy:
   - recommend `superpowers` and `hookify` first
   - do not require `everything-claude-code`, `claude-code-settings`, and `ralph-loop` on first install by default
7. If the result is `manual_actions_pending`, list the remaining manual actions instead of calling the install failed.
```

## Short Prompt For New Users

If you want a one-line version for onboarding:

```text
Please install this repository using the strongest recommended VibeSkills full-featured path for the current platform: auto-detect Windows vs Linux, run the one-shot bootstrap and deep doctor, report `fully_ready` vs `manual_actions_pending` vs `core_install_incomplete` truthfully, do not pretend host plugins/MCP/provider secrets were auto-installed, and follow the default host-plugin policy of recommending `superpowers` and `hookify` first without requiring all five host plugins on day one.
```

## Suggested README / Community Framing

If you want to place this into a README, issue template, or community post, add one sentence like this:

> Copy the prompt below into your AI coding assistant and it will choose the correct Windows or Linux install path automatically, while still reporting the remaining host-side provisioning work truthfully.
