# Verify Gate Family Index

`scripts/verify/` 是 VCO 的 evidence-running surface。这个索引负责 gate family 分组、典型运行顺序，以及把操作者引到定义 proof contract 的页面。

## Start Here

- minimum closure proof contract: [`../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md`](../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md)
- operator-oriented verify entrypoint: [`README.md`](README.md)
- broader operator surface: [`../governance/README.md`](../governance/README.md)

## What This Page Owns

- verify-family grouping
- typical closure-facing gate run order
- executable gate discovery inside `scripts/verify/`

This page does not own:

- the authoritative closure contract
- the latest PASS / FAIL truth
- the broader operator console outside `scripts/verify/`

Current truth always lives in `outputs/verify/*.json`.

## Typical Closure Run Order

When a structure-changing cleanup batch needs the standard proof surface, the usual verify sequence is:

1. `vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1`
   - fast routing smoke before deeper contract checks
2. `vibe-router-contract-gate.ps1`
   - routing contract validation
3. `vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1`
   - canonical to bundled packaging parity
4. `vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1`
   - mirror-only drift rejection
5. `vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1`
   - output versus fixture boundary
6. `vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1`
   - installed runtime freshness
7. `vibe-release-install-runtime-coherence-gate.ps1`
   - install, check, and release coherence
8. `vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1`
   - current cleanliness contract

The authoritative requirement set for closure remains [`../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md`](../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md).
