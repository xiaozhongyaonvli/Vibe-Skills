# 2026-04-04 Owner Consumer Consistency Proof

Updated: 2026-04-04

## Purpose

This is the final Wave 4/5 sign-off surface for the active `remaining-architecture-closure` program.

It answers one question only:

Have the repository's live consumers been reduced to shared canonical owners, with any surviving fallbacks explicitly bounded and non-authoritative?

This page does not replace the root requirement / plan, the live summary, or the closure receipt. It is the architecture-proof surface those pages can point at.

## Owner -> Consumer Matrix

| Semantic Concern | Canonical Owner | Live Consumers | Bounded Fallback | Why Fallback Is Non-Authoritative | Proof Evidence | Current Status | Residual Non-Claim |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Installed runtime defaults, gate paths, receipt paths, runtime markers | `packages/contracts/src/vgo_contracts/installed_runtime_contract.py` | `apps/vgo-cli/src/vgo_cli/repo.py`, `apps/vgo-cli/src/vgo_cli/install_gates.py`, `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/runtime_freshness.py`, `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/runtime_coherence.py`, `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/policies.py`, `scripts/common/runtime_contracts.py` | PowerShell helper emergency defaults when the Python contract bridge cannot be loaded | Fallback activates only when the contract bridge fails; the contract module remains the primary owner for defaults and merge behavior | `tests/integration/test_installed_runtime_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_cli_runtime_entrypoint_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_verification_runtime_entrypoint_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_frontmatter_gate_runtime_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_powershell_installed_runtime_contract_bridge.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete; final sign-off depends on fresh closure evidence in `docs/status/closure-audit.md` | PowerShell emergency fallback still exists and is intentionally retained |
| Runtime payload packaging semantics and runtime-artifact ignore policy | `packages/contracts/src/vgo_contracts/runtime_surface_contract.py` plus `config/runtime-core-packaging.json` | `packages/installer-core/src/vgo_installer/materializer.py`, `packages/installer-core/src/vgo_installer/uninstall_service.py`, `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/policies.py`, `scripts/common/runtime_contracts.py` | Compatibility projections in runtime payload manifests and installed-runtime materialization | Payload projections remain delivery shapes for existing consumers; semantic packaging rules live in the contract/config owner surfaces | `tests/integration/test_runtime_surface_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_runtime_core_packaging_roles.py`, `tests/integration/test_runtime_config_manifest_roles.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete; projection boundary explicit | Flat payload projections and dist materializations remain compatibility outputs, not deleted surfaces |
| Mirror topology and nested compatibility materialization rules | `packages/contracts/src/vgo_contracts/mirror_topology_contract.py` | `packages/installer-core/src/vgo_installer/materializer.py`, `packages/installer-core/src/vgo_installer/uninstall_service.py`, `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/policies.py` | `vgo_verify.policies._mirror_topology_targets_fallback` and legacy-input tolerance in uninstall/cleanup flows | Fallback is only a compatibility path if the shared contract helper is unavailable or legacy governance input still appears; it is no longer the semantic owner | `tests/integration/test_mirror_topology_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_verification_core_cutover.py`, `tests/unit/test_mirror_topology_contract.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete; fallback explicitly bounded | Optional `nested_bundled` topology and conservative uninstall behavior remain intentionally supported |
| Adapter registry semantics and descriptor resolution | `config/adapter-registry.json` plus `packages/contracts/src/vgo_contracts/adapter_registry_support.py` | `packages/installer-core/src/vgo_installer/adapter_registry.py`, `packages/adapter-sdk/src/vgo_adapters/descriptor_loader.py`, `apps/vgo-cli/src/vgo_cli/hosts.py`, `scripts/common/resolve_vgo_adapter.py`, retained PowerShell installer/check/bootstrap surfaces | Compatibility wrappers still call into installer-core / contract support | Wrappers preserve entrypoint compatibility but do not own a second registry schema or resolution algorithm | `tests/integration/test_adapter_registry_single_source.py`, `tests/integration/test_adapter_sdk_registry_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_cli_host_registry_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_powershell_installer_registry_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_check_entrypoint_registry_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_bootstrap_entrypoint_registry_cutover.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete | PowerShell and runtime-neutral wrappers remain public compatibility surfaces |
| Router contract/config bundle loading | `packages/runtime-core/src/vgo_runtime/router_contract_support.py` | `packages/runtime-core/src/vgo_runtime/router_contract_runtime.py`, router runtime entrypoints, router bridge execution path | Runtime entrypoints and router compatibility wrappers remain thin delegates | Support-layer loading is the only semantic owner; runtime wrappers are presentation or execution adapters only | `tests/integration/test_router_core_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_router_contract_gate_fixture_cutover.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete | Compatibility router entry surfaces remain retained where users or tests still call them |
| CLI orchestration vs package-owned cores | split CLI modules under `apps/vgo-cli/src/vgo_cli/` and package-owned executors in installer-core / runtime-core / verification-core | top-level install/check/uninstall wrappers, runtime entrypoints, CLI commands | Public wrappers and bridge modules remain compatibility adapters | The bridges only load and call package-owned executors; they no longer own installer/runtime semantics inline | `tests/integration/test_cli_main_infra_separation.py`, `tests/integration/test_cli_installer_core_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_cli_verify_runtime_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/unit/test_vgo_cli_core_bridge.py`, `tests/unit/test_vgo_cli_installer_bridge.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete | Wrapper entrypoints remain intentionally retained as cross-platform/public surfaces |
| Verification logic vs runtime-neutral Python shims | package-owned verification modules under `packages/verification-core/src/vgo_verify/` | `scripts/verify/runtime_neutral/*.py` entrypoints and the PowerShell verify gates that invoke them | shared local `_bootstrap` helper and retained runtime-neutral entry shims | Compatibility shims only bootstrap/import the package-owned evaluator/main functions; they no longer duplicate verification semantics inline | `tests/integration/test_verification_runtime_entrypoint_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/integration/test_verification_core_cutover.py`, `tests/runtime_neutral/test_runtime_entrypoint_helper.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete | Runtime-neutral shims remain shipped compatibility surfaces |
| Governance operator gate inventories and cleanup modes | `config/operator-preview-contract.json` and `config/phase-cleanup-policy.json` | `scripts/governance/release-cut.ps1`, `scripts/common/vibe-governance-helpers.ps1`, `scripts/governance/phase-end-cleanup.ps1`, cleanup support helpers | `release-cut.ps1` postcheck -> apply fallback, release gate degraded fallback, phase-cleanup compatibility mode projection | The config surfaces now own the inventories and modes; script fallbacks only preserve degraded or historical compatibility behavior | `tests/integration/test_release_cut_gate_contract_cutover.py`, `tests/runtime_neutral/test_release_cut_operator.py`, `tests/integration/test_phase_cleanup_operator_contract_cutover.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete; final sign-off still requires generated-artifact-aware closure wording | Release/postcheck and cleanup compatibility fallbacks remain intentionally bounded |
| Runtime payload role classification and grouped runtime-marker projections | `packages/contracts/src/vgo_contracts/governance_runtime_roles.py` and `config/version-governance.json` | installer/runtime packaging flows, dist manifest generation, freshness/coherence verification gates, governance review docs | flat projection lists remain for existing payload consumers | Grouped role projections classify ownership without breaking consumers that still require flat projection lists | `tests/integration/test_version_governance_runtime_roles.py`, `tests/unit/test_governance_runtime_roles.py`, `tests/integration/test_dist_manifest_surface_roles.py`, `tests/integration/test_runtime_config_manifest_roles.py` | owner/consumer cutover complete | Flat projection compatibility remains intentionally published |
| Live closure authority and sign-off reading order | current governed requirement / plan, this proof doc, `docs/status/current-state.md`, `docs/status/closure-audit.md` | `docs/status/README.md`, `docs/status/roadmap.md`, `docs/architecture/legacy-topology-audit.md`, `docs/plans/README.md`, `docs/requirements/README.md` | `docs/status/operator-dry-run.md` and the small set of verify-retained historical pages remain archival evidence | Historical pages remain accessible for auditability but are no longer allowed to act as live authority surfaces, and zero-consumer worklog leaves have been removed from the public docs surface | focused readback of touched docs plus `git diff --check`; final verification outcome recorded in `docs/status/closure-audit.md` | sign-off surface established | Historical docs remain intentionally minimized and clearly demoted |

## Fresh Final Sign-Off Evidence

- focused contract-cutover verification: `5 passed in 2.09s`
- final full regression: `403 passed, 66 subtests passed in 509.44s (0:08:29)`
- hygiene: `git diff --check` -> clean
- active closure receipt for the final decision: `docs/status/closure-audit.md`

## Residual Boundary Inventory

The remaining residual boundaries are architecture evidence, not hidden failure:

- release closure gates still keep degraded fallback behavior if `config/operator-preview-contract.json` is unavailable
- `release-cut.ps1` still falls back from `postcheck_gates` to `apply_gates` when needed
- PowerShell installed-runtime helpers still keep an emergency fallback shape when the Python contract bridge is unavailable
- mirror-topology and uninstall flows still retain conservative compatibility fallbacks for legacy inputs and ownership-safe cleanup
- compatibility shims remain retained where live callers, manifests, or tests still depend on them
- `nested_bundled` remains an optional topology / on-demand materialization surface rather than a guaranteed physical payload
- `outputs/**` remains a governed evidence surface rather than a deletable clean-room area
- protected `third_party/*` mirrors remain guarded dependency roots
- host-managed plugin / MCP / dependency surfaces and platform-proof ceilings still bound what the repository can honestly claim

## Sign-Off Rule

Root closure for `remaining-architecture-closure` is allowed only when the current worktree also has:

1. fresh full regression evidence,
2. clean `git diff --check` hygiene,
3. no contradictory live status surfaces, and
4. explicit residual-boundary wording that keeps the fallbacks above non-authoritative.

The final completion decision is recorded in `docs/status/closure-audit.md` and summarized in `docs/status/current-state.md`.
