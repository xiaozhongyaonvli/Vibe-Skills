# Current State

Updated: 2026-04-05

## What This Page Is

This page is the live runtime-entry summary for the completed `remaining-architecture-closure` batch.

It exists to answer three questions only:

1. where the current closure truth lives;
2. what is proven complete in the frozen scope versus still deferred;
3. what the next governed operator hop should be after closure.

It is not the canonical contract layer and it must not over-claim beyond the frozen closure proof or the current governed follow-up requirement.

## Authority

This page is a live summary, not the source of truth.

## Mission Outcome

当前 `remaining-architecture-closure` 根计划已经在冻结范围内完成。

这里的“完成”只表示以下事情已经同时成立：

- 剩余高价值 duplicated semantic owners 已经被切到 shared contracts / package-owned cores，或被明确降级为 bounded compatibility fallbacks
- live status spine、架构审计面、proof surface 与 closure language 已经对齐到同一份 2026-04-04 真相
- fresh regression、focused verification、hygiene evidence 都已经重新获得
- residual boundaries 和 non-claims 已经被写明，不再靠含糊措辞掩盖

## Live Snapshot

Fresh verification evidence for the final sign-off state:

- latest focused microphase verification: `python3 -m pytest tests/integration/test_release_cut_gate_contract_cutover.py tests/runtime_neutral/test_release_cut_operator.py -q` -> `5 passed in 2.09s`
- latest direct gate evidence: `scripts/verify/vibe-wave64-82-closure-gate.ps1` -> `PASS`
- artifact-dependent gate note: `scripts/verify/vibe-wave83-100-closure-gate.ps1` still requires generated evidence under `outputs/dashboard`, `outputs/release`, and `outputs/learn`; its historical failure mode is missing artifacts, not a reopened semantic-owner regression
- final full regression: `python3 -m pytest tests/contract tests/unit tests/integration tests/e2e tests/runtime_neutral -q` -> `403 passed, 66 subtests passed in 509.44s (0:08:29)`
- hygiene: `git diff --check` -> clean
- phase cleanup: no `table5`-owned `pytest`, `pwsh`, or `node` processes remained after final verification

## Completed 2026-04-04 Closure Scope

The completed frozen scope now includes:

- frontmatter gate runtime-contract delegation
- CLI runtime entrypoint delegation
- verification runtime entrypoint delegation
- operator preview postcheck contract alignment
- PowerShell installed-runtime fallback reduction
- mirror-topology contract delegation
- release closure gates contract cutover
- live status-spine catch-up for `roadmap`, `operator-dry-run`, `plans/README`, and `path-dependency-census`
- final owner -> consumer proof assembly and closure-language alignment

## Residual Boundaries That Remain By Design

The following surfaces remain intentionally bounded after closure:

1. Fallbacks remain explicit.
   - release closure gates still keep degraded fallback behavior if `config/operator-preview-contract.json` is unavailable; `release-cut.ps1` still falls back from `postcheck_gates` to `apply_gates`; PowerShell installed-runtime helpers still keep an emergency fallback shape when the Python contract bridge is unavailable; mirror-topology and uninstall flows still keep conservative compatibility fallbacks.

2. Compatibility surfaces remain retained.
   - retained Python shims, runtime-neutral verification shims, and public wrapper entrypoints still exist while live callers, tests, or packaging surfaces depend on them; `nested_bundled` remains an optional topology surface rather than a guaranteed always-materialized payload.

3. Evidence and dependency boundaries remain governed.
   - `outputs/**` remains a governed evidence surface; protected `third_party/*` mirrors remain dependency roots; host-managed plugin / MCP / dependency surfaces and platform-proof ceilings still limit what this repo can honestly prove.

## Deferred Post-Closure Backlog

These are no longer hidden blockers inside the closed root plan. They are separate follow-up tracks:

- outputs strict-mode adoption and the zero-tracked-outputs decision
- third-party source-root parameterization / externalization
- archive / prune windows beyond the current live status spine
- any blanket compatibility-shim deletion program

## Non-Claims

Do **not** claim any of the following from the completed 2026-04-04 closure batch:

- every bounded fallback is gone
- every retained compatibility shim is now deletable
- every artifact-dependent closure gate will pass without its required generated evidence artifacts
- the repository is globally zero-dirty
- the repo has proven host-managed plugin / MCP surfaces or platform ceilings beyond its own governance scope

## Next Operator Hop

The next governed hop should start from a new requirement document for one deferred backlog track at a time.

Recommended next options are:

- outputs strict-mode / tracked-output retirement
- third-party source-root parameterization
- GitHub-visible docs worklog purge and archive-surface shrinkage
- targeted shim-retirement only where live callers can be proven gone
