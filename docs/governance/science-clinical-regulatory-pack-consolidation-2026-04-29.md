# Science Clinical Regulatory Pack Consolidation

> Historical / Retired Note: This document discusses retired or cleanup-context routing terminology. The current routing model is `skill_candidates -> skill_routing.selected -> selected_skill_execution -> skill_usage`; old terms here are historical only and are not current runtime states.

Date: 2026-04-29

## Summary

`science-clinical-regulatory` is consolidated as a clinical-data, clinical-documentation, treatment-planning, clinical decision support, and medical-device QMS routing pack.

The six-stage Vibe runtime is unchanged, and skill usage remains binary:

```text
skill_candidates -> skill_routing.selected -> skill_usage.used / unused
```

No advisory, consult, primary/secondary, or stage-assistant execution model is introduced.

## Counts

| Field | Before | After |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `skill_candidates` | 7 | 7 |
| `route_authority_candidates` | 0 | 7 |
| `stage_assistant_candidates` | 0 | 0 |
| `task_allow` | planning, coding, research | planning, coding, research, review |
| physical directory deletion | 0 | 0 |

`route_authority_candidates` mirrors `skill_candidates` for compatibility and documentation. It is not a second execution model.

## Kept Route Owners

| User problem | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| ClinicalTrials.gov / NCT lookup, trial phase, eligibility, endpoints, and study status | `clinicaltrials-database` |
| openFDA, FDA drug labels, adverse events, recalls, 510(k), PMA, and regulatory safety data | `fda-database` |
| CPIC, PharmGKB/ClinPGx, PGx, gene-drug evidence, allele function, and genotype-guided dosing lookup | `clinpgx-database` |
| Clinical report writing and review: CARE case reports, CSR, SAE, SOAP notes, discharge summaries, HIPAA/de-identification checks | `clinical-reports` |
| Individual treatment plans, care plans, SMART goals, medication plans, and follow-up plans | `treatment-plans` |
| ISO 13485 medical-device QMS, quality manual, CAPA, gap analysis, and certification documentation | `iso-13485-certification` |
| Clinical decision support documents, GRADE evidence, treatment algorithms, cohort analysis, and biomarker stratification | `clinical-decision-support` |

## No Moved-Out Skills

No skill is moved out of this pack in this pass. Each retained skill owns a distinct user-facing problem and has scripts, references, or templates that should not be deleted without a separate asset review.

## No Physical Deletion

No bundled skill directory is physically deleted. A later pruning pass must separately prove that a directory has no distinct route, no useful migrated assets, and no live config/test/lockfile dependency before deletion.

## Protected Boundaries
