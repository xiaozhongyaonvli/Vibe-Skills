# Global Pack Consolidation Audit

> Historical / Retired Note: This document discusses retired or cleanup-context routing terminology. The current routing model is `skill_candidates -> skill_routing.selected -> selected_skill_execution -> skill_usage`; old terms here are historical only and are not current runtime states.

日期：2026-04-27

## 结论先看

本报告是只读体检，不修改 live routing，不删除 skill 目录。

- pack 总数：41
- P0：6
- P1：10
- P2：25
- 当前最高风险 pack：`code-quality`

## 边界说明

- 本报告只说明治理优先级，不代表删除建议。
- 具体 pack 收敛需要下一轮 problem-first 设计。
- 带 scripts、references、examples 或 assets 的 skill 不能直接删除。
- 若后续修改路由，需要补对应 route regression probe。
