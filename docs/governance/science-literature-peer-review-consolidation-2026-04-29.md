# Science Literature And Peer Review Consolidation

> Historical / Retired Note: This document discusses retired or cleanup-context routing terminology. The current routing model is `skill_candidates -> skill_routing.selected -> selected_skill_execution -> skill_usage`; old terms here are historical only and are not current runtime states.

Date: 2026-04-29; high-prune update: 2026-04-30

## Summary

This pass shrinks `science-literature-citations` into a literature discovery, citation management, and evidence extraction pack. Scholarly paper review and paper-quality scoring now belong to `science-peer-review`.

The 2026-04-30 high-prune update removes the low-value standalone `biorxiv-database` and `bgpt-paper-search` route owners. Their useful trigger surface is absorbed into `literature-review`: bioRxiv/preprint coverage and full-text/evidence-table extraction are part of literature review work, not separate helper expert calls.

The six-stage Vibe runtime is unchanged, and skill usage remains binary:

```text
skill_candidates -> skill_routing.selected -> skill_usage.used / unused
```

## Counts

| Pack | Field | Before | After |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| `science-literature-citations` | `skill_candidates` | 12 | 5 |
| `science-literature-citations` | `route_authority_candidates` | 10 | 5 |
| `science-literature-citations` | `stage_assistant_candidates` | 2 | 0 |
| `science-peer-review` | `skill_candidates` | 3 | 3 |
| `science-peer-review` | `route_authority_candidates` | 0 | 3 |
| `science-peer-review` | `stage_assistant_candidates` | 0 | 0 |

High-prune delta inside `science-literature-citations`: `7 -> 5` skill candidates, `7 -> 5` route authorities, `0 -> 0` stage assistants.

## Kept Literature Owners

| User problem | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| PubMed, PMID, MeSH, MEDLINE | `pubmed-database` |
| OpenAlex, DOI, authors, institutions, citation graph | `openalex-database` |
| Zotero API and Zotero library automation | `pyzotero` |
| BibTeX, DOI validation, bibliography formatting | `citation-management` |
| Systematic review, meta-analysis, PRISMA, bioRxiv/preprints, full-text evidence extraction, evidence tables | `literature-review` |

## Peer Review Owners

| User problem | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| Formal manuscript or grant review | `peer-review` |
| Evidence strength, bias, confounders, GRADE, Cochrane-style critique | `scientific-critical-thinking` |
| ScholarEval, paper-quality rubric, quantitative research scoring | `scholar-evaluation` |

## Removed Or Moved

| Skill | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `open-notebook` | Physically deleted after live-reference cleanup; it is a broad notebook/document-chat product integration, not a literature/citation expert. |
| `paper-2-web` | Removed from `science-literature-citations`; retained for publishing/promotion surfaces. |
| `peer-review` | Removed from `science-literature-citations`; owned by `science-peer-review`. |
| `scholar-evaluation` | Removed from `science-literature-citations`; owned by `science-peer-review`. |
| `scientific-critical-thinking` | Removed from `science-literature-citations`; owned by `science-peer-review`. |
| `biorxiv-database` | Physically deleted; bioRxiv and preprint review triggers are absorbed into `literature-review`. |
| `bgpt-paper-search` | Physically deleted; full-text extraction and evidence-table triggers are absorbed into `literature-review`. |
