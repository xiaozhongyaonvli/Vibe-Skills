# Prompt-Based Install (Recommended Default)

This is the default public install entrypoint.

## First confirm two things

1. Confirm the host: `codex`, `claude-code`, `cursor`, `windsurf`, or `openclaw`
2. Confirm the public version: `Full Version + Customizable Governance` or `Framework Only + Customizable Governance`

The real profile mapping is:

- `Full Version + Customizable Governance` -> `full`
- `Framework Only + Customizable Governance` -> `minimal`

## Prompt files to copy directly

- [`prompts/full-version-install.en.md`](./prompts/full-version-install.en.md)
- [`prompts/framework-only-install.en.md`](./prompts/framework-only-install.en.md)
- [`prompts/full-version-update.en.md`](./prompts/full-version-update.en.md)
- [`prompts/framework-only-update.en.md`](./prompts/framework-only-update.en.md)


## What AI should do in this flow

The install assistant should:

- ask for the host first, then the version
- execute only on the five supported hosts
- map the public versions only to `full` or `minimal`
- choose `bash` or `pwsh` based on the operating system
- never ask you to paste secrets into chat
- distinguish “installed locally” from “online-ready”
- end with a concise result summary plus manual follow-up
