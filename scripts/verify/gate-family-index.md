# Verify Gate Family Index

`scripts/verify/` 是 evidence-running surface。这里仅负责 family 分组和常见运行顺序；最新真相仍在 `outputs/verify/*.json`。

## Start Here

- closure proof contract: [`../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md`](../../docs/status/non-regression-proof-bundle.md)
- verify entrypoint: [`README.md`](./README.md)
- broader operator surface: [`../governance/README.md`](../governance/README.md)

## Typical Closure Order

1. `vibe-pack-routing-smoke.ps1`
2. `vibe-router-contract-gate.ps1`
3. `vibe-version-packaging-gate.ps1`
   current meaning: canonical-only packaging governance + generated compatibility wiring
4. `vibe-mirror-edit-hygiene-gate.ps1`
   current meaning: block repo-tracked mirror reintroduction
5. `vibe-output-artifact-boundary-gate.ps1`
6. `vibe-installed-runtime-freshness-gate.ps1`
7. `vibe-release-install-runtime-coherence-gate.ps1`
8. `vibe-release-truth-consistency-gate.ps1`
9. `vibe-repo-cleanliness-gate.ps1`
